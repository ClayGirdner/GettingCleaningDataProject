-'run_analysis.R' downloads data, preps data, then performs the following steps to analyze the data:
	-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
	-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
	-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
